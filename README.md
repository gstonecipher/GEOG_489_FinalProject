# GEOG_489_FinalProject
A Jupyter notebook for Pacific Crest Trail planning

The app allows the user to put in the GPS coordinates of a start location and an end location, their direction of travel, and whether theyâ€™re starting or finishing at a terminus (either the Mexican or Canadian border). The app then extracts the segment of trail between the two points and calculates the length, and also provides instruction on creation an elevation profile. The app also helps the user to identify resupply options within 10 miles of that trail segment, and finally visualizes all the layers together on a map.
